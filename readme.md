The above project has two parts designated as q1 and q2.
Q1. - Used Contextual word embeddings like Glove, fastext,Cbow and skipgram to dertemine the embedding of different hindi words of fixed dimensions and used cosine similarity to determine the similarity score between those words.
Q2 - We fine tuned a pretrained Bert model pretrained by AI for bharat on hindi dataset consisting of Hindi sentences. We used the finetune model to assign NER tag to the tokens present in the dataset.
